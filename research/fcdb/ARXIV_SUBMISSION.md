### arXiv submission package: research/fcdb

This folder contains the LaTeX source for the Enishi FCDB paper and a helper script to prepare an arXiv-compliant tarball.

- Main file: `main.tex`
- Helper: `arxiv_pack.sh` (bundles sources, detected includes, graphics, and optional `.bib` files)

#### How to build locally

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
# if you add a .bib later, also run:
# bibtex main && pdflatex main.tex && pdflatex main.tex
```

#### Create the arXiv tarball

```bash
chmod +x ./arxiv_pack.sh
./arxiv_pack.sh
```

This creates a file like `arxiv_fcdb_YYYYMMDD.tar.gz` along with `arxiv_manifest.txt` listing included files.

Notes:
- Currently the paper uses an inline bibliography block, so no `.bib` is included.
- If you add `\bibliography{...}` or `\addbibresource{...}`, the packer will include all `*.bib` files in this directory by default.
- Graphics are autodetected from `\\includegraphics{...}` and common extensions: `pdf`, `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`.
- EPS warning (arXiv): Convert `.eps` to `.pdf` yourself before compiling/submitting (e.g., `epstopdf fig.eps`). arXiv compiles with shell escape disabled, so automatic EPSâ†’PDF conversion will not run.

#### Checklist updates (paper sections to verify)
- Ensure `main.tex` contains:
  - Experimental Setup and Reproducibility
  - Anti-commutativity Measurement: Design and Results (with placeholders)
  - Complexity Assumptions and $O(1{+}\varepsilon)$ Read Bound
  - Security Model and Revocation Boundary
  - Preservation table extended with Formal $\to$ Invariant $\to$ Test mapping
- Appendices include Reproducibility Artifacts with script references to `validation/` and `loadtest/k6_3hop.js`.

#### Packaging notes
- If you add figures for measurement (heatmaps, ablation, throughput-latency curves), place them in this folder and reference via `\\includegraphics{...}` so `arxiv_pack.sh` auto-detects them.
