# Enishi Database Design

## Overview
Own+CFA-Enishi: Graph database with PackCAS, temporal support, and capability-based security.

## Architecture
- **enishi-core**: Cid, Cap, Monoid, path_sig, class_sig, trace NF
- **enishi-cas**: PackCAS, cidx, bloom filters, WAL, GC
- **enishi-graph**: RID→CID, adj, posting, temporal
- **enishi-exec**: Adaptive bloom, plan switcher, meet-in-middle
- **enishi-api**: GraphQL, gRPC
- **enishi-tools**: benchmarks, validators

## Phase A (Completed)
- PackCAS with bloom filters
- Basic graph operations
- GraphQL API
- Performance targets: 3-hop ≤13ms, H≥0.97, WA≤1.15 ✅

## Phase B (Completed)
- Path/Class signatures for query optimization
- Trace normal form for key explosion reduction
- Manifest diffing for efficient caching ✅

## Phase C (Completed)
- Adaptive 三段Bloom + shard(type×time)
- Meet-in-the-middle + ε-greedy Plan Switcher
- Snapshot CID for popular temporal points
- Performance targets: 3-hop ≤9.5ms, 9-hop 35-80ms, H≥0.989 ✅

## Phase D (Current)
- 所有型統合 (Rust ownership types)
- Cap Functor合成 (capability functor composition)
- Manifest/導出 Cap証跡 (capability tracing)
- Performance targets: 3-hop 9.3-9.8ms, WA 1.05-1.10×, H 0.988-0.989
